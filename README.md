# üîí DLLCrypt - DLL Steganography Tool

A PowerShell-based steganography tool that allows you to hide encrypted files inside legitimate DLL files. This project demonstrates how data can be covertly embedded within binary files while maintaining their original functionality.

## üéØ Features

- **Steganography**: Hide files inside legitimate DLL files
- **AES-256 Encryption**: Strong encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation
- **Minimal Footprint**: Modified DLLs remain functional and appear normal
- **Password Protection**: Files are encrypted with user-defined passwords
- **Easy Extraction**: Simple command-line interface for file recovery

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Windows PowerShell 5.0 or later
- Execution policy allowing script execution

### Basic Usage

#### 1. Hide a file inside a DLL
```powershell
.\src\encoder.ps1 -dllPath "samples\dxcorehelper.dll" -secretFilePath "secret.txt" -password "MySecretPassword123" -outputDllPath "output\dxcorehelper_modified.dll"
```

#### 2. Extract the hidden file
```batch
.\src\launcher.bat "output\dxcorehelper_modified.dll" "MySecretPassword123"
```

Or directly with PowerShell:
```powershell
.\src\decoder.ps1 -encodedDllPath "output\dxcorehelper_modified.dll" -password "MySecretPassword123"
```

## üîß How it works

Uses AES-256 encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation to hide files inside DLL binaries. The tool appends encrypted data after a signature marker, keeping the original DLL functionality intact.

## üõ°Ô∏è Stealth Tips

### System DLL Camouflage
For better stealth, consider using these common system DLL names:
- `msvcr120.dll`, `msvcp140.dll` - Visual C++ redistributables
- `api-ms-win-*.dll` - Windows API sets  
- `d3d11.dll`, `dxgi.dll` - DirectX components
- `kernel32.dll`, `user32.dll` - Core Windows DLLs (‚ö†Ô∏è be careful!)
- `sqlite3.dll`, `libcurl.dll` - Common third-party libraries

### Placement Strategy
- **System32/SysWOW64**: High privilege but heavily monitored
- **Program Files**: Blend with existing applications
- **AppData/Temp**: Less suspicious for "temporary" components
- **Game/Software folders**: Hide among legitimate DLLs

### Additional Stealth
- Match file timestamps with nearby legitimate files
- Keep file sizes reasonable (avoid suspiciously large DLLs)
- Use legitimate DLL signatures when possible
- Consider multiple small files instead of one large payload

## üîç Detection and Mitigation

This technique may be detected by:
- File size analysis (comparing with known good DLLs)
- Entropy analysis of the file tail
- Signature-based detection of the marker
- Advanced malware analysis tools
